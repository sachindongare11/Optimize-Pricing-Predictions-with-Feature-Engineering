# Optimize-Pricing-Predictions-with-Feature-Engineering

Project Title: Streamlining Car Pricing for Faster Sales Process

Project Description:

At our nationwide semi-new car dealership, we pride ourselves on providing efficient and accurate pricing to our customers. Our current pricing strategy relies on a multiple linear regression model, which considers 17 features to estimate car prices. While this model has been effective in ensuring fair and competitive pricing, concerns have been raised about its impact on the sales process.

During a recent meeting, our sales team highlighted that the extensive data collection process for the 17 features can significantly slow down the sales process, potentially affecting revenue. To address this concern, management has tasked us with optimizing the pricing model by reducing the number of features to ten or fewer without compromising its performance metrics, such as R-squared and RMSE.

Our objective is clear: streamline the pricing process to improve efficiency while maintaining the simplicity and interpretability of the linear regression model. To achieve this, we will undertake the following steps:

1.Feature Selection: 
We will carefully analyze the original set of 17 features and identify the most impactful variables for predicting car prices. This selection process will involve assessing the correlation between features, their individual predictive power, and their relevance to our business objectives.
2.Model Evaluation: 
After narrowing down the feature set, we will retrain the multiple linear regression model using the selected variables. It is imperative to evaluate the model's performance using key metrics such as R-squared and RMSE to ensure that it remains comparable to the original model.
3.Validation and Testing: 
Once the streamlined model is developed, we will validate its performance on a separate dataset to assess its robustness and generalizability. Additionally, we will conduct A/B testing to compare the efficiency of the streamlined pricing process with the previous one, measuring key metrics such as sales cycle duration and revenue impact.
4.Documentation and Implementation: 
Finally, we will document the revised pricing model, including the selected features, model coefficients, and performance metrics. This documentation will serve as a reference for our sales team and other stakeholders. We will also provide training and support to ensure the smooth implementation of the streamlined pricing process.
